# API-Project
Weather and Thesaurus API's

Uploaded 3 jar files in order for this program to work. (pircbot.jar, json.jar, gson.jar)

This program greets the user if user enters (Hello, Hi, hello, hi)
  
And with the keywords cheesecake, the bot will serve a "virtual/imaginatory" cheesecake
In addition, keywords: weather (gives you the details about a specific city/area) &&  synonym (gives you synonyms for a specific word)

You can access the bot to see if it works through the website: https://webchat.freenode.net (Channel: #freeSpace)
